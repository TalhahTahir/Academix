The vision is changed: teacher will make course (he will set fees, catagory, name, etc)
admin will validate course 
teacher will add lectures and documents
push launch button
student enroll

fee paid by student will be stored in LMSâ€™s account
we will have a vault screen for teacher and admin, where they can see their total balance, history, and withdraw it

change admin course declearation
payment logic updation
